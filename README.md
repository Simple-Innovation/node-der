# simple-der

Use Node and TypeScript to manage DER format certificates with Jest for testing.

## Build

To build the project clone or fork it and open in a development environment.

Install the required npm packages.

```sh
npm install
```

## Test

I use [vscode-jest-runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner) to help in running tests directly in vscode.

To test it you can use npm.

```sh
npm run test
```

# Publish

```sh
npm login
npm publish --access=public
```
